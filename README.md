### Side Note

I created this demo because I haven't seen any online demo for integrating Cornerstone3D into a Vue application, and I hope this demo would be of help to kickstart your Vue-Cornerstone3D projects. Let me know if you've come across another interesting demo, found other resources, or have ideas for improving this one!
